# Astronomical choreography

## Origins

This work is an implemetation of method, proposed in article "Braids in classical gravity" by Cristopher Moore, 1993. This project was prepared during my studying at Skoltech University at Moscow as final project for course "Numercial ingeneering".

## What is this project about

Suppose that we have system of N astronomical objects, who is moved by gravity forces.
Generally this problem is called [N-body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_problem) and its well known that starting from N=3, N-body problem can be solved only for special cases.

This work is covering more narrow situation called [N-body choreography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_choreography) in which we are looking only for periodic solutions. So our question is: Which periodic orbits are possible for given N? I once discovered Moore's article and was amazed by how elegantly this problem can be solved with variational principle so I decided to implement it and visualize process of numerical learning. Further I will first briefly cover underlying theory and show animated results I achieved.

## Theory

//TODO

To investigate this question, see referenced literature:
- "Braids in classical gravity" by Cristopher Moore, 1993
- "New Orbits for the n-Body Problem" by Robert J. Vanderbei

## Results

Let's see what we have

### Simple 2-body solution
